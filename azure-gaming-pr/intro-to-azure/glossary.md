## ARM templates

Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates) is used to implement infrastructure as code for your Azure solutions. The template is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. The template uses declarative syntax, which lets you state what you intend to deploy without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it. In the template, you specify the resources to deploy and the properties for those resources. To learn more, see [What are ARM templates?](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview)

## Azure Resource Manager

Azure Resource Manager is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account. You use management features, like access control, locks, and tags, to secure and organize your resources after deployment. To learn more, see [What is Azure Resource Manager?](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview)

## Resource

Azure resource is a manageable item that is available through Azure. Resource groups, subscriptions, management groups, and tags are also examples of resources.

## Resource group

Azure resource group - A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group includes those resources that you want to manage as a group. You decide which resources belong in a resource group based on what makes the most sense for your organization. See [Resource groups](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview#resource-groups).

## Resource provider

Azure resource provider is a service that supplies Azure resources. Examples include Microsoft.Compute, which supplies the virtual machine resource. Microsoft.Storage is another common resource provider. See [Resource providers and types](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types).
