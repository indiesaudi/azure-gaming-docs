# Set up account to access Azure services

To start using Azure services, the first thing you have to do to create an Azure account.

This article provides links to detailed guides to create individual and organizational user accounts.

## Individual user

For individual users, use your personal Microsoft account to get access to Azure and all consumer-oriented Microsoft products and cloud services.

For more information, see [Microsoft account overview](https://account.microsoft.com/account). For step-by-step tutorial, see the learning module - [Create an Azure account](/learn/modules/create-an-azure-account/).

## Organizational user

### Sign up for Azure

Organizational users can set up their account either by purchasing directly from microsoft or enlisting an Azure partner for a managed cloud solution.

1. Purchase directly from Microsoft.
   Get the same pay-as-you-go pricing through the Azure website or through an Azure sales specialist.
   * Get started with Azure right away through the Azure website - [**Create an Azure account**](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/).

### Setting up Azure Active Directory

[Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) is a cloud-based identity and access management service. This service helps your employees access external resources, such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other SaaS applications. Azure Active Directory will help your employees access Azure services.

### Setting up a tenant

To build apps that use the Microsoft identity platform for identity and access management, you need access to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. A tenant represents an organization. It's a dedicated instance of Azure AD that an organization or app developer receives at the beginning of a relationship with Microsoft.

These are links to resources to help you set up a tenant.
