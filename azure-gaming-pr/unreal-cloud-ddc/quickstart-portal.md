Available resource types: [Azure Storage Account](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction), [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview), [Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/introduction), and [Azure Virtual Network IP services - Public IP](/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-addresses).

> [!NOTE]
> Instructions on how to configure these advanced options will soon be available.

1. On the **Advanced** tab, provide the following inputs:

    * **Use existing Storage Account**: Select if you would like to use an existing storage account. Otherwise a new storage account will be created.
    * **Storage Account Name**: Enter a unique name for a new Storage Account.
