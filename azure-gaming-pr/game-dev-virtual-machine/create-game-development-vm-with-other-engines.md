# Quickstart: Create a Game Development Virtual Machine with other game engines

If you don't need have an Unreal Engine pre-installed, you can still leverage the Game Development Virtual Machine with either Windows 10 or Windows Server 2019 that bundles common game development tools, and then install your game engine of choice after deploying this VM. Some popular game engines in the market which are worth mentioning but not limited to are: [CryENGINE](https://www.cryengine.com/),  [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en), [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), [O3DE](https://www.o3de.org/), and [Unity](https://unity.com/).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.com/free). Please note Azure free accounts do not support GPU enabled virtual machine SKUs. To understand what Azure subscriptions support GPU SKUs, please refer to this <a href="./offer-types.md" target="_blank">offer types chart</a>.
- Multi-tenant Hosting Rights for Windows 10 is required. Verify you have an [eligible Windows 10 subscription license](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/windows-desktop-multitenant-hosting-deployment#subscription-licenses-that-qualify-for-multitenant-hosting-rights) or a [Visual Studio subscription](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/client-images) for dev/test scenarios.

## Deploy your Game Development Virtual Machine

### Create a Game Dev VM instance

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Or, the [Azure Game Development VM](https://aka.ms/gamedevvm) marketplace page, click "Get It Now" under the Azure icon, click "Continue" in the pop up window to give consent and then skip the next step .

1. In the Portal, go to the Azure Marketplace and search **Azure Game Development VM**

| Virtual Network | Create a new or select an existing Virtual Network space the VM |
| Subnet Name | Choose the subnet name you want to assign to this VM. The Private IP address is the next available IP address in the subnet |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is best practice to not expose Virtual Machines directly to the internet with a public IP. [Plan for inbound and outbound internet connectivity](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/plan-for-inbound-and-outbound-internet-connectivity#design-recommendations.md)

On the **Data Storage** tab complete the following information, then select **Next: Management >**:

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If you don’t want to use the striped disk, please set the number of data disks to be 1. Set the number to 0 if you don’t want to attach a data disk at all. This VM will still have an OS disk and a temporary data disk as the default configuration.
> - It is highly recommended to choose at least 2 disks that will be striped together for the best IOPS performance, and to install your source control and game projects on that drive for the best experience and available space on the VM. The C drive defaults to 256GB and could quickly run out of space for medium to large projects.

On the **Tags** tab, complete the following information then select **Next: Review + create >**

Tags are used to categorize resources, usually for billing management purposes. If you don't need tags now, you can skip this page and check out [resource tagging](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-tagging.md) to learn more. 

On the **Review + create** tab, ensure validation passes and review the information that will be used during deployment. If the validation has failed, review the previous sections.

Select **Create**.

Once the VM is deployed, RDP directly to the VM and install your engine of choice.

> [!NOTE]
>  
>- There is no additional charge for the software that comes pre-loaded on the virtual machine. You do pay the compute cost for the VM size that you chose in the  **Size**  step. If you choose Teradici or Parsec as your remote access tool, you bring your own license to the VM on Azure.
>- Provisioning takes 10 to 20 minutes. You can view the status of your VM on the Azure portal.

## Access the Game Development VM

After the VM is created and provisioned, there are three methods to access this VM, depending on the **Remote access technology** you chose before.

**Method 1:** RDP. This remote method is always available.

1. Follow the steps listed to [connect and sign on to Azure-based virtual machine](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/connect-logon.md). Use the credentials that you configured when created this virtual machine before. If you enable AAD for this VM, you can also use your corporate credentials for RDP access [if you meet the requirements](/azure/active-directory/devices/howto-vm-sign-in-azure-ad-windows#requirements.md).  

1. You're ready to start using the tools that are installed and configured on the VM. Many of the tools can be accessed through Start menu tiles and desktop icons.

> [!NOTE]
> You may see a command prompt window pop up which shows the Microsoft GDK or other components are being installed in the background. This may take up to 10 minutes. You can safely ignore it but leave the window open, as it will automatically close once all the tasks are finished.

Alternatively, you can follow the steps to remote into the Game Development Virtual Machine with either [Teradici](./remote-to-vm-with-teradici.md) or [Parsec](./remote-to-vm-with-parsec.md) depending on your chosen method of remote access technology.

## Install the Game Engine of your choice
