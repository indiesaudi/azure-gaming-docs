# Quickstart: Create a Game Development Virtual Machine with Unreal Engine

Get up and running with a Windows 10 or Windows Server 2019 Game Development Virtual Machine which has Unreal Engine and other common game development tools pre-installed. Unreal Engine is an incredibly powerful and advanced real-time 3D creation tool for photorealistic visuals and immersive experiences.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.com/free). Please note Azure free accounts do not support GPU enabled virtual machine SKUs. To understand what Azure subscriptions support GPU SKUs, please refer to this <a href="./offer-types.md" target="_blank">offer types chart</a>.
- An [Epic Games account](https://www.epicgames.com/id/login) to accept Epic Games store End User License Agreement after signing in to this VM.

On the **Tags** tab, complete the following information then select **Next: Review + create >**

Tags are used to categorize resources, usually for billing management purposes. If you don't need tags now, you can skip this page and check out [resource tagging](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-tagging.md) to learn more. 

On the **Review + create** tab, ensure validation passes and review the information that will be used during deployment. If the validation has failed, review the previous sections.

Select **Create**.

> [!NOTE]
>  
>- There is no additional charge for the software that comes pre-loaded on the virtual machine. You do pay the compute cost for the VM size that you chose in the  **Size**  step. If you choose Teradici or Parsec as your remote access tool, you bring your own license to the VM on Azure.
>- Provisioning takes 10 to 20 minutes. You can view the status of your VM on the Azure portal.

## Access the Game Development VM

After the VM is created and provisioned, there are three methods to access this VM, depending on the **Remote access technology** you chose before.

**Method 1:** RDP. This remote method is always available.

1. Follow the steps listed to [connect and sign on to Azure-based virtual machine](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/connect-logon.md). Use the credentials that you configured when created this virtual machine before. If you enable AAD for this VM, you can also use your corporate credentials for RDP access [if you meet the requirements](/azure/active-directory/devices/howto-vm-sign-in-azure-ad-windows#requirements.md).  

1. Once you sign on to the VM, you'll be prompted immediately to accept Epic Games store End User License Agreement (EULA). If your Epic Games account has already accepted the latest EULA agreement, there is no need to accept it again, and you will be redirected to the desktop after your Epic Games account is authenticated. This is a one-time step when first deploying a new game development VM, and you don’t need repeat this step when you access this VM again.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Your VM may stay at the Windows welcome screen for up to 1 minute until you see the above EULA Agreement--this is normal.  

1. You're ready to start using the tools that are installed and configured on the VM. Many of the tools can be accessed through Start menu tiles and desktop icons.

> [!NOTE]
> You may see a command prompt window pop up which shows the Microsoft GDK or other components are being installed in the background. This may take up to 10 minutes. You can safely ignore it but leave the window open, as it will automatically close once all the tasks are finished.

:::image type="content" source="./media/create-game-development-vm-for-unreal/user-configuration-tasks-messages-terminal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of terminal window showing user configuration tasks are still completing":::

Alternatively, you can follow the steps to remote into the Game Development Virtual Machine with either [Teradici](./remote-to-vm-with-teradici.md) or [Parsec](./remote-to-vm-with-parsec.md) depending on your chosen method of remote access technology.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can delete the resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources.

1. On the Overview page for the VM, select the Resource group link.
2. At the top of the page for the resource group, select Delete resource group.
3. A page will open warning you that you are about to delete resources. Type the name of the resource group and select Delete to finish deleting the resources and the resource group.
